## Event Tracking Application
The application is designed to catalog the dates and times of upcoming events for its users. Users can review data including the full CRUD functionality. The users also can adjust their preferences and privacy settings. Users also can make an account for personalized storage, access, and editing of their events.

The application has a user login screen. The user can either login to their current account or create a new account. It can only be previewed first if users wish to review the application. To manage preferences, users receive an initial pop-up requesting permission. By using the main menu, user can later update their preferences and privacy settings. The main screen allows users to view their events, currently display in a table/grid layout. Events can also be deleted on the same screen. A new screen was created for adding or updating an event. The design may vary as the application progresses in development.

I developed the application by creating user stories. By reviewing the user stories, I defined the overall purpose and features needed to satisfy the users. I worked on the basics and layout before moving into more complex functionality.

I used multiple tools to test the functionality of my application. I reviewed and corrected errors as they occurred. I would run the application to test its functionality. I checked the layout, navigation, and interactions. I also reviewed the log, problems, and other tools used for troubleshooting. 

I applied innovation in developing a user-centered UI for adding and updating event data. Instead of making multiple activities, I used fragments to switch between the viewing event table and the add/update event section. I can easily add, change or removing the layouts of certain features without having to redo the main activity. Fragments also bring in modularity and reusability since they are not exclusively to a certain activity.

I think my skills where utilized in developing the add/update event screen. It was originally a blank fragment, but I was able to added in the correct components to fulfill its purpose. Then I added the database coding to add and update the events. I also included a way to return back the previous screen.
